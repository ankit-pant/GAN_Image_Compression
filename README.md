# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based Image Compression

### Introduction
	This project aims at creating an AI model to compress images while retaining as much quality as possible. The implementation is done (from scratch) using Tensorflow.
	A GAN was created and trained on various kinds of images (from CIFAR, etc.). The trained model then is able to compress images belonging to three categories:
		1. Airplane
		2. Automobile
		3. Flower
	Performance of the model was measured using several schemes that are usually used to compare two images. The difference between the original and compressed images were measured using:
		1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
		2. Multiscale SSIM (MS-SSIM)
		3. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)
		4. L1 distance
	
	
### File Information
	A short discription of the various files that are present in the repository is as follows:
	#### Airplane_model.py
		Contains the trained model that is used to compress images of type 'Airplane'
	#### Automobile_model.py
		Contains the trained model that is used to compress images of type 'Automobile'
	#### Flower_model.py
		Contains the trained model that is used to compress images of type 'Flower'
	#### compare_images.py
		This file contains code to compare the original and compressed images
	#### compress.py
		This file integrates all the three models and compresses images based on the image type
	#### convert_images.py
		This file contains code that was used to convert the high resolution images in the Flower dataset to lower resolution so that it can be used to train the model (training on high resolution images was not computationally feasible)
	#### data_extract.py
		This file contains code to convert the images in the datasets into arrays that is then used totrain the model
	#### stride.ai_project_proposal.pdf
		This file contains the initial proposal for this project
	#### team18_presentation.pdf
		This file contains a short presentation on the project
	#### team18_report.pdf
		This file contains the pproject report
